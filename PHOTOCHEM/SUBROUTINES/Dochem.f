C-mc - OK, if I come back to this later I should remember two things here:
c- there is a mix of two different codes here. In one, I took RAINGC , HEFF, and some of the others to NQ+NP, and computed them directly.  If we are going to do the tridiagonal, they should be removed completely and I should go back to the original behavior, which is jsut uing H2SO4 everywhere.  At the same time, Kevin had S8 not being rained out at all because it isn't soluble. Either way, what we have in this section is both wrong and confusing...
