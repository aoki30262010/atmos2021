Absorption cross section from Kasting's photochemical code. Not sure what original source is. 
Pavlov et al. (2001) added these reactions and cite Rabalais et al. (1971) and Yung et al. (1984).

We use the following branching ratios, again following Pavlov et al. (2001):
0.40: CH2CCH2 --> C3H3 + H
0.15: CH2CCH2 --> C3H2 + H2
0.06: CH2CCH2 --> C2H2 + CH23
