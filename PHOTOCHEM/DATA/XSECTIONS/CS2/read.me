For branching, we assume short wavelength (<228 nm) leads to direct photolysis, --> CS + S
and long wavelength (>281 nm) leads to photoexcitation, --> CS2X


July 2016: 
CS2 and CS2X have been combined into 1 cross section file
2 QY files were made where each reaction is either 1 or 0 depending upon wavelength
Old Xsections code has different QY for ISOS, no file was made for this because old code will be called
	if ISOS flag is on
