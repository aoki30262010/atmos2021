Absorption cross section from Kasting's photochemical code. Not sure what original source is. 
Pavlov et al. (2001) added these reactions and cite Zelikov and Watanabe (1953) and Back and Griffiths (1967).
Using the following branching ratios, also after Pavlov et al. (2001):
0.49: C2H4 + hν ---> C2H2 + H2
0.51: C2H4 + hν ---> C2H2 + H + H
